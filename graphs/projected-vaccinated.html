<h1>Herd Immunity</h1>
<p>
  How long will it take until enough people in Ireland have been vaccinated to
  provide full herd immunity?
</p>
<p>
  For full immunity we should aim to vaccinate 95% of the population, though
  much of normal life should be able to resume earlier.
</p>
<p>
  We can calculate an estimated date as follows. There are around
  <strong>4 million</strong> people aged over twelve in Ireland, and we are
  fully vaccinating people at a 7-day average rate of around
  <strong>{{ charts.estDailyRate | formatNumber }}</strong> doses per day.
</p>
<p>
  This means it will take
  <strong>{{ charts.estDuration | formatNumber }}</strong> days to vaccinate 95%
  of the adult population. The projected herd immunity date is
  <strong>{{ charts.estimated95Date | formatDate }}</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  This estimate will be updated daily as more vaccination information is
  received.
